## System Overview

This solar energy system consists of the following key components:

1. **Solar Panels**: Generate electricity from sunlight.
2. **Charge Controller**: Regulates power from the solar panels to the battery bank.
3. **Battery Bank**: Stores energy for nighttime or cloudy days.
4. **Inverter**: Converts DC power to AC power for household appliances.
5. **AC Distribution Panel**: Distributes power to the home.
6. **Optional Backup Generator**: Provides power during extended low sunlight periods.
7. **Monitoring System**: Tracks performance and energy production.
